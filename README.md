## Project 1
The goal of the project is to predict the price of a home sold in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010 with explanatory variables such as the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.

## Project 2
The goal of this project is to predict the future weekly sales for each department in each store based on the data from the Walmart Store Sales Forecasting Kaggle challenge. The historical data is from 45 Walmart stores located in different regions and is composed of weekly sales data for various stores and departments from February 2010 to February 2011. 

## Project 3
In this project, we deal with a data set consisting of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, with each being labelled as positive or negative. The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model to predict the sentiment of a movie review.

## Project 4
The dataset contains about 1 million anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000. The goal is to recommend movies to users based on their favorite genre.
